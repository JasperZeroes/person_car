# person_car
Table 'person' has an id, first_name, last_name, gender, email, date_of_birth , country_of_birth and car_id columns while Table 'car' has id, make, model and price columns to it. Table PERSON has a foreign key called car_id which refers to the primary key (id) in the Table CAR. I'll be performing various joins to both tables.
